  - Nice picture of the board - where'd you find it?

Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Yes. Found everything!

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Could use more structural content tags like main, aside, section, etc.
    - Arguably board members on the home page should be marked up with lists rather than paragraphs.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - Yes. Looks nice!
