                <h1 class="">Voter Registration</h1>
                <h4>Can I register in person?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes! Registration forms are available at most government offices and post offices, 
                    or you may register in person Monday through Friday at the St. Lawrence County Board of 
                    Elections Office, 80 State Hwy 310, Canton, New York, between 9am and 5pm. Our summer hours, 
                    between Memorial Day and Labor Day, are 8am to 4pm. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="pt-2">Which form do I choose?</h4>
                <p>
                    When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive the correct form. 
                    One form allows you to register for the first time, the other form is used if you've moved within 
                    St. Lawrence County and wish to notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain active voting status. 
                    Also note it can take up to a month for registrations from the DMV and other social service agencies to reach the board. 
                    Therefore your registration will be postmarked timely as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.
                </p>
                <h4>How do I register by mail?</h4>
                <p> If you wish to register by mail, please do one of the following:
                        <ul>

                </p>

                </p>
                <h4>Can I re-register or change my information?</h4>
                <p> 
                    Yes! Name, address or party enrollment changes can be made by submitting a new registration form. <br>
                    If you move, your notice of change of address must be received by the Board of Elections 20 days before the election in which you seek to vote.
